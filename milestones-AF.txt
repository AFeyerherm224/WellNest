Contributions:
≈ 3.5 hours - Learning Swift syntax/watching app development tutorials
≈ 1.5 hours - Wrote code for the UI navigation of the app
≈ 30 minutes - Tweaked the Github/synax of files

Summary:
This challenge was a lot more difficult than I thought, and organizing 4 people's
schedules and ideas to collaborate and create a full product was taxing.
It was really good to get the difficulty out of the way now and figure out what works best for 
everyone in terms of teamwork and work division. I personally had a lot of fun learning a new
language, although it was time-consuming for a less-than-impressive result. Swift feels less
formal and more intuitive, and I enjoy the look of the final product.
