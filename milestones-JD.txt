  Joseph DiSalvo - Milestone 
1. ) I took care of the User Input for the beginning portion of the project

User Input (swift):

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var username: String = ""
    @State private var password: String = ""

    var body: some View {
        Form {
            Section(header: Text("Login Information")) {
                TextField("Username", text: $username)
                SecureField("Password", text: $password)
            }

            Button(action: {
                print("Logging in with username: \(username) and password: \(password)")
            }) {
                Text("Login")
                    .foregroundColor(.blue)
            }
        }
    }
}

2. ) Time log 
4 hours - Reading, watching, and learning about swift 
1 1/2 hours - wiritng a proper user input 
1 hour - Lab with partners 


3. ) Rubric 
15+ functionality 
	- text inputs read in, buttons work properly, correct User interface 

10+ user experience 
	-users find it easy to use 

10+ good computer science practices 
	-commenting, formatting, etc 

5+ go out of comfort zone and add some 'fun' additional features 
	-fun added feature TBD; will specify fun in final reflection

4) Reflection: 
All in all everything went smoothly, but there is definitely a lot to be learned while using another coding language. I have a small amount of experience using swift from some prior practice in Codecademy; online resources are very helpful, as well, when trying to better understand concepts and syntax. It is enjoyable working with my group, and I am looking forward to the challenge and an overall finished product.
