Contributions:
= Hour in Lab - Researching the development process in going to the app/frontend vs backend.
= 3 hours - Learning Swift syntax/setting up vscode for Swift
= 1 hour - Developing a basic ui structure

Summary:
In summary, I learned what feels like a little bit about swift. Nothing wrong with that but it took three hours and I felt like it was a lot of jargon. I felt like the whole process took a while and that's a headache in general. Overall I read a lot of articles and such on UI using swift and watching videos on how to use swift to implement the UI. The next thing after our front end is created is making the back end and I cannot decide if I want to learn Node.js or Python for the back end. But I will probably end up working on the back end rather than the front end.

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {  // VStack arranges elements vertically
            Text("Hello, SwiftUI!")
                .font(.largeTitle)
                .padding()

            Button(action: {
                print("Button was tapped!")
            }) {
                Text("Tap me")
                    .font(.title)
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.blue)
                    .foregroundColor(.white)
                    .cornerRadius(10)
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
